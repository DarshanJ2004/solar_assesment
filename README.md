# 🌞 AI-Powered Rooftop Solar Analysis Tool

This project is an intelligent web application that uses satellite-style rooftop images to analyze and assess the solar installation potential of residential or commercial buildings. Powered by computer vision and language models via OpenRouter API, it provides accurate reports, area estimation, and ROI predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload satellite-style rooftop images
- Analyze usable area for solar panels
- Generate installation recommendations
- Estimate ROI, energy output, and payback period
- User-friendly web interface using Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit (Web UI)
- OpenCV (Image processing)
- OpenRouter API (LLM integration)
- PIL (Image handling)
- NumPy
- Requests
- dotenv (API key management)

---

## 🛠️ Local Setup Instructions

### 1. 📦 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rooftop-solar-analysis.git
cd rooftop-solar-analysis
````

### 2. 🐍 Create and Activate Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. 📄 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. 🔑 Add Your OpenRouter API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following content:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

You can get your free API key by signing up at [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

---

### 5. ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

It will open a local web app at `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🖼️ How to Use

1. Launch the app.
2. Upload a clear rooftop image (satellite style).
3. Wait for analysis — the app will:

   * Process the image to find usable area
   * Send it to the LLM for generating a report
4. View the result:

   * Estimated solar coverage area
   * Recommended panel count
   * Installation guide
   * ROI, payback time, and more

---

## 🧪 Example

You can test with images inside the `example_images/` folder provided.

---

## 🧰 Example Output

Sample Output Snippet:

```
Estimated Usable Area: 32.5 m²
Suggested Panel Count: 13 (250W each)
Expected Monthly Output: 390 kWh
Estimated Payback Period: 4.2 years
ROI Over 20 Years: ~180%
```

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Automatic roof segmentation using semantic segmentation models
* Cloud-based image sourcing via Google Maps API
* Integration with real-time solar pricing APIs
* PDF export of reports
* User authentication and dashboard for solar installers
